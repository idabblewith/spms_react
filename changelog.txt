NAVIGATION BAR & FOOTER
- Staff Dropdown and Profile dropdown both have SPMS Profile & Divisional Profile
	- Suggest: Only having in Profile
- Profile says "Welcome, {name}" with a chevron.
	- Suggest: Change to a profile Image (potentially with name) and chevron. This would save space
- Suggest having live search for search projects on nav bar
	- with a debouncer for 2 seconds
	- that displays list below search bar of matching items with more than 3 characters
	- in this way, users will get a dropdown of projects and access things faster
- Year in footer is hardcoded
	- Suggest adding a javascript datetime identifier to the footer; it will automatically adjust based on server time.
- Django version shouldn't be in footer
	- Suggest removing as this is only helpful to the maintainer, and should
	be apparent in the code.


MAIN PAGE
- Remove duplicate functionalities
	- browse projects
	- create project
	- download published BCS annual reports
- Format current ARAR Report buttons into one dropdown with links as before
- Move the Current Annual Report Dropdown into the Scince Project Management Sysetm Block (It currently takes up a lot of space but barely serves a function). This will make use of some of the space.


- Changes MADE:
	- Moved API and User Manual to Profile Dropdown to conserve space and as they do not have secondary items.
	(Old way commented out)
	- Rearranged Documentation to be above DBCA account, so last item is logout in Profile
	- Removed View Profile (for own profile) from staff.
	(Old way commented out)
	- Moved the Profile dropdown to the right as it seemed oddly placed before/ searchbar was on the right
	(Just need to rearrange if changing back)
	- Added to footer: a dynamic year based on javascript
	- Removed Django version from footer
	- Removed other coding related stuff from footer as not relevant to enduser:
		("Passed" circleci: https://circleci.com/gh/dbca-wa/sdis)
		("coverage": https://coveralls.io/github/dbca-wa/sdis?branch=master)
		("docs": https://sdis.readthedocs.io/) - Already linked in profile

		- DONE FIXED & created a separate component for navbar menus (NavMenu)
	- DONE Add Color to Current Annual Report Dropdown/Icon on Left
		- DONE Issue with MenuList being too bright, you cant see text
	- DONE (When open, default is open for first accordian - tasks) Add Color to Accordian Dropdowns so it is obviously clickable and 
	stands out from the contents / or similar
	- MOVED Seek clarification if we have a DBCA favicon or if Pythia one is okay

TODO D3:
	**CREATING PROJECT MODEL AND GIVE BASE DATA ON BACKEND**	

	- Implement Search functionality for Projects (Header)
	- Consolidate NavMenu by attempting to remove _hover and _active and placing functionality into bgStyle and fontColorStyle terns
	- Create a Root link variable to the documentation to be used by both the navbar and footer
	- Alternatively create the documentation within the website (Preferred SEEK PERMISSION)
	- Make only authorised users/maintainers have access to /api (reject back to home if try to access) and have the button not visible 	if not one such user
	


On Ben's return:
	- Seek clarification if we have a DBCA favicon or if Pythia one is okay
	- Seek clarification on whether NavMenus should open on hover or should be clicked going forward (currently clicked)
	- Seek permission to create site-based documentation

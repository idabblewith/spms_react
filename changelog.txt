NAVIGATION BAR & FOOTER
- Staff Dropdown and Profile dropdown both have SPMS Profile & Divisional Profile
	- Suggest: Only having in Profile
- Profile says "Welcome, {name}" with a chevron.
	- Suggest: Change to a profile Image (potentially with name) and chevron. This would save space
- Suggest having live search for search projects on nav bar
	- with a debouncer for 2 seconds
	- that displays list below search bar of matching items with more than 3 characters
	- in this way, users will get a dropdown of projects and access things faster
- Year in footer is hardcoded
	- Suggest adding a javascript datetime identifier to the footer; it will automatically adjust based on server time.
- Django version shouldn't be in footer
	- Suggest removing as this is only helpful to the maintainer, and should
	be apparent in the code.


MAIN PAGE
- Remove duplicate functionalities
	- browse projects
	- create project
	- download published BCS annual reports
- Format current ARAR Report buttons into one dropdown with links as before
- Move the Current Annual Report Dropdown into the Scince Project Management Sysetm Block (It currently takes up a lot of space but barely serves a function). This will make use of some of the space.


- Changes MADE:
	- Moved API and User Manual to Profile Dropdown to conserve space and as they do not have secondary items.
	(Old way commented out)
	- Rearranged Documentation to be above DBCA account, so last item is logout in Profile
	- Removed View Profile (for own profile) from staff.
	(Old way commented out)
	- Moved the Profile dropdown to the right as it seemed oddly placed before/ searchbar was on the right
	(Just need to rearrange if changing back)
	- Added to footer: a dynamic year based on javascript
	- Removed Django version from footer
	- Removed other coding related stuff from footer as not relevant to enduser:
		("Passed" circleci: https://circleci.com/gh/dbca-wa/sdis)
		("coverage": https://coveralls.io/github/dbca-wa/sdis?branch=master)
		("docs": https://sdis.readthedocs.io/) - Already linked in profile

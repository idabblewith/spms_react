                    <p>BIO&rsquo;s objective is to deliver a fully functional first iteration of the WA‑BDR by mid-June - a platform that:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>provides a central store for Western Australian biodiversity datasets;</li>
                            <li>applies quality assurance, quality control, access management, and archival processes to those datasets; and</li>
                            <li>makes those datasets discoverable, searchable, and viewable by WA‑BDR users.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </Box>

                    <p>The WA-BDR will need to be adequately populated with historical biodiversity data prior to launch, with this seed data expected to be sourced from a range of custodians, including agencies and industry.&nbsp; It its first year, the BIO data collation program will focus on sourcing high-volume, high-quality seed data to prepare for launch.</p>
                    <p>In subsequent years, BIO will transition to a rolling BIO data collection program identifying new sources, identifying datasets that fill known temporal and spatial gaps in the existing collection, developing capability handle difficult-to-transform and pre-digital data, and developing behavioural and professional incentivies to encourage data custodians to contribute data to the WA-BDR.</p> <p>Both work during the initial year of the BIO data collation program, and work undertaken in subsequent years, will look to use automation and process re-engineering to allow new data to enter the WA-BDR without the need for extensive manual processing.</p>
